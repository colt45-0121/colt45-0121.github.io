{"pages":[],"posts":[{"title":"1","text":"Hello, my name is WYK, a undergraduate student in Beijing and this is my first official blog on https://colt45-0121.github.io/. As a matter of fact, I once posted several posts here as a test, but now I’ve removed them and this post can be regarded as the very first post that has some actual contents in it. (or maybe not) I have spent my past life of 19 years trying to reach a level, or a status in which I can have access of absolute freedom. Obviously I haven’t found it yet, but I believe that it won’t take me a long time after this. Basically, this blog is a record of my life and the fun things I do in the version of English. For now, it is powered by “Hexo” blogging platform and one of its gorgeous themes “Icarus”. The comment system is powered by “Valine” and you can feel free to leave any message to me it the commenting section.","link":"/2022/04/11/001/"}],"tags":[],"categories":[]}
