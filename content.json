As a matter of fact, I once posted several posts here as a test, but now I’ve removed them and this post can be regarded as the very first post that has some actual contents in it. (or maybe not) I have spent my past life of 19 years trying to reach a level, or a status in which I can have access of absolute freedom. Obviously I haven’t found it yet, but I believe that it won’t take me a long time after this. Basically, this blog is a record of my life and the fun things I do in the version of English. For now, it is powered by “Hexo” blogging platform and one of its gorgeous themes “Icarus”. The comment system is powered by “Valine” and you can feel free to leave any message to me it the commenting section.","link":"/2022/04/11/001/"},{"title":"2","text":"The second problem in C4 of data structure class There doesn’t seem to be too much difficulties after I coded it myself but due to my ignorance of the specific usages of several characters, it became hard to start up. 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960616263646566676869707172737475767778798081828384858687888990919293949596979899100101102103104105106107108109110111112113114115116117118119120121122123124125126127128129130131132133134135136137138139140141142143144145146147148149150151152153154155156157158159160161162163164165166167168169170171172173174175176177178179180181182183184185186187188189190191192#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;#include &lt;string.h&gt;struct node{ char c; int l;};//defined a structure that contains a character and the sequence of linestruct node rec[300];//record all (){}struct node stack[300];//a stackchar s[300];//a string to record current lineint main(){ // open file FILE *fp; fp = fopen(&quot;example.c&quot;, &quot;r&quot;); //init variables int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0, l = 0, m = 0, n = 0, o = 0, error = 0, flag = 0; //get the file line by line //while threr is no obvious error while (fgets(s, 300, fp) != NULL &amp;&amp; error == 0) { l++; //l means the sequence of line n = strlen(s); //the number of characters in the current line //go over the current line by characters for (k = 0; k &lt; n; k++) { if (s[k] == '(') //no risk, put in all the way { rec[i].c = s[k]; rec[i].l = l; stack[j].c = s[k]; stack[j].l = l; i++; j++; } else if (s[k] == '{') { if (stack[j - 1].c == '(' &amp;&amp; j != 0) //( cannot be put forward than { { error = 1; printf(&quot;without maching '(' at line %d\\n&quot;, stack[j - 1].l); break; } else //put in all the way { rec[i].c = s[k]; rec[i].l = l; stack[j].c = s[k]; stack[j].l = l; i++; j++; } } else if (s[k] == ')') { //record first rec[i].c = s[k]; rec[i].l = l; i++; if (stack[j - 1].c != '(' || j == 0) //the last character in stack doesn't match { error = 1; printf(&quot;without maching ')' at line %d\\n&quot;, l); break; } else //popstack { stack[j - 1].c = '\\0'; stack[j - 1].l = 0; j--; } } //the same else if (s[k] == '}') { rec[i].c = s[k]; rec[i].l = l; i++; if (stack[j - 1].c != '{' || j == 0) { error = 1; printf(&quot;without maching '}' at line %d\\n&quot;, l); break; } else { stack[j - 1].c = '\\0'; stack[j - 1].l = 0; j--; } } else if (s[k] == '/' &amp;&amp; s[k + 1] == '/') //meets // { break; } else if (s[k] == '/' &amp;&amp; s[k + 1] == '*') //meets /* { for (m = k + 2, flag = 0; m &lt; n; m++) { if (s[m] == '*' &amp;&amp; s[m + 1] == '/') { flag = 1; break; } } while (flag == 0) //is not stopping in this line, prepare for the next line { //need to clear the current line first strcpy(s, &quot;\\0&quot;); fgets(s, 300, fp); l++; n = strlen(s); for (k = 0; k &lt; n; k++) { if (s[m] == '*' &amp;&amp; s[m + 1] == '/') { flag = 1; break; } } } //move the marker to the finishing position //pay attention to +1 //2 characters in */ k = m + 1; } else if (s[k] == '&quot;') { for (m = k + 1; m &lt; n; m++) { if (s[m] == '&quot;') { break; } else if (s[m] == '\\\\') //!!! \\\\ is regarded as ONE character !!! { m++; } } k = m; } else if (s[k] == '\\'') { for (m = k + 1; m &lt; n; m++) { if (s[m] == '\\'') { break; } else if (s[m] == '\\\\') { m++; } } k = m; } } //clear the current line before getting the next line strcpy(s, &quot;\\0&quot;); } if (error == 0 &amp;&amp; j == 0) //no error at all { for (o = 0; o &lt; i; o++) { printf(&quot;%c&quot;, rec[o].c); } } else if (error == 0 &amp;&amp; j == 1) //no crushed-match in the midway, but an unmatched left at last { printf(&quot;without maching '%c' at line %d\\n&quot;, stack[0].c, stack[0].l); } //close file fclose(fp); return 0;}","link":"/2022/04/16/002/"}],"tags":[],"categories":[]}
